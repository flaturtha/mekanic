<h3 class="center">For AOL, Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Thunderbird, Apple Mail, Postini & More</h3>
<br>

To ensure that the email we send you ends up in your inbox, and isn't mistakenly sent to the junk folder, please whitelist my email address: atticus@talesofmurder.com.

Below is information on how to whitelist me with AOL, Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, ThunderBird and Postini. Even if your ISP or email program is not listed, with these instructions you should be able to figure out how to whitelist our email address at any ISP or with any email program.

Also, if you find email from atticus@talesofmurder.com in your spam or junk folder, please take that opportunity to tell your mail program that it is not spam by hitting the "not spam", "not junk" or similar button, as that will train your program to whitelist it.
