	<p>Now you’ve got the tools <em>(the cheat sheet is on its way to your inbox)</em> to help you go from blank page to completed article.</p>
	<p>But ask yourself this question: “Is this draft good enough to go on my website or send off as a guest post?”</p>
	<p>If you’re like me, or Papa Hemingway, your first draft probably isn’t as good as it gets. That’s why we say, “writing is rewriting.”</p>
	<p>But how do you know what to change? What’s working? What’s not?</p>

	<h2>Simple. Get an editor!</h2>

	<p>For a limited time, I’ll read, review, and comment on your article using my 10-point editor’s checklist. I normally charge $50 for this level of review &amp; editing, but as a special, one-time introductory offer, I’ll provide it for just $10! That’s 80% off my standard rate.</p>
	<p>But it’s only available to you from this page!</p>
	<p>I will read your article, review it using my 10-point checklist, mark nap you grammar or usage issue, and return to you within 24 hours (orders received after 4:30 p.m. CST on Friday will be edited the following Monday and returned by Tuesday morning).</p>
	<p>It will include a red penned copy — like your English teacher gave you, but no failing grades, I promise! — as well as commentary on things you can do to improve your article.</p>
	<p><em>My job is not to tell you what you did wrong (unlike your English teacher!). My job is to help you improve your article to it is the best it can possibly be.</em></p>
	<p>Simply fill out the questionnaire, below, and I will go to work to help you polish your article.</p>
	<p><em>Don’t have it written yet?</em> No problem. Once you’ve completed the form, I’ll email you a link where you can upload your article. Then 24 hours later, you’ll have your reviewed &amp; edited article.</p>
