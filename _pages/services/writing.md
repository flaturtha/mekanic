		<h1>WRITING IS EASY. <span>(UNTIL&nbsp;IT’S&nbsp;NOT.)</span></h1>
		<h2 class="italics">“I don’t need to hire a writer! Writing is easy. You just put down your thoughts on paper, or type them into Word, and you’re done.”</h2>
	</div>
</header>


<main class="page-main">
	<div class="wrap">
		<p class="large bold">Sure. Writing is easy. Until it’s not. Until you open a fresh document in Word and find yourself staring at a crisp, clean, empty screen.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, your brain is as blank as the new doc. Those “thoughts” you were going to just type into Word are less clear, less defined.</p>
		<p>New thoughts rush in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="italics">“This is an important article, so it has to be perfect.”</li>
			<li class="italics">“Remember, the first sentence has to grab the reader.”</li>
			<li class="italics">“Oh, and I have to optimize for search. That means using lots of keywords … doesn’t it?!”</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Oh! Writing is &hellip; hard!</h3>
		<p>At least good writing is. Mediocre, average writing is easy.</p>
		<p>But you want your article, your blog to stand out from the crowd, right?</p>
		<p>Then why waste your valuable time writing blog articles when you have a business to run? Why spend your day staring at the blank page, hoping something will magically appear when you have more important things to do.</p>
		<h3>Instead, hire a writer &hellip;</h3>
		<p>Whether for a one-off article or a collection to build the core content of your blog, hiring a professional writer can mean the difference between a <em>ho-hum</em> blog article and one that can speak to the true desires of your audience and drive action!</p>
